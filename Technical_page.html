   <header>BMW 328 MILLE MIGLIA (1940)</header>
    <article>
      <p>The BMW 328 is indelibly linked to the tradition of BMW motorsports. In 1940, the racing car made a clean 
        sweep at the legendary Mille Miglia, scoring the 
        overall victory, the team victory and third, fifth and sixth places. But even before this, the BMW 328 was racking 
        up wins – such as its first race triumph at the 1929 “Alpenfahrt” and the 1936 “Eifelrennen”. At the Mille Miglia 
        six years later, the BMW 328 cemented its reputation as the most successful sports car in Europe at the time. The 
        winning car was driven by Fritz von Hanstein and Walter Bäumer, both from Germany. <code> After 8 hours and 55 minutes 
        and an average speed of about 105 miles an hour, they won the race by a wide margin.</code>

        Racing doesn’t require much power when the design is right. The best example of this is the BMW 700 RS. With only 
        70 PS and weighing in at just 1,410 pounds, this lightweight racer still managed to achieve an impressive 100 mph. 
        In 1960, the BMW racing car won the German mountain championship with driver Hans Stuck at the wheel. Stuck was just getting 
        started back then. <code> The car itself went on to win quite a number of races until 1964.</code>

    <p>
      Today, the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring in Germany is a classic. The first of its kind was held in 
      1970, and BMW race cars were among those at the starting line. Behind the wheel were semi-professionals and also 
      amateurs such as Germans Clemens Schickentanz and Hans-Joachim Stuck (son of the legendary “mountain king” Hans 
      Stuck – see above). <code> Their vehicle was the BMW 2002 TI, which with 180 HP and a top speed of around 137 mph achieved 
      an impressive overall win. The BMW 02 series is today considered the forerunner of the compact sports sedan. </code>

    <header>BMW 3.0 CSL (1973)</header>
    <p>  
       Starting in 1961, with the excellent engine with overhead camshaft, installed on the ‘new generation’ of 1500 saloons, 
        BMW’s success continued to grow. A key step was taken in 1968 with the first six-cylinder engines, the 2500 and 2800, 
        leading to elegant Coupés with very light interiors and 2.5-3.2-litre engines following the saloons’.  
    </p>  
    <p>
      No list of the best of BMW’s classic racing cars would be complete without the BMW 3.0 CSL (Coupé Sport Leichtbau). 
      Rather than list all its wins, it would be easier to list the places where the touring car did not do well. As well 
      as triumphing in the European Touring Car Championship on six occasions, it also came first in its class at Le Mans (France) and 
      secured an overall victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA). Some models packed up to 800 PS
      and just blazed around the circuits. <code> The BMW M colors were first revealed to the world on its exterior in 1973. And it also became the 
      first BMW Art Car. Without a doubt, the BMW 3.0 CSL is a special milestone in BMW’s racing history. </code>

      You can declare a variable in three ways:

        The 1979 BMW M1 Procar Championship was the inaugural season of the BMW M1 Procar Championship. 
        The series ran as a support category to the European rounds of the 1979 Formula One season.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Next up is another dream car, the BMW M1. Its design was a radical departure from the BMW 3.0 CSL, 
        but it was just as dominant on the track. The BMW M1 even 
        got its own racing series, the BMW Procar Series. <code> As part of the Formula 1 Races, the best race car drivers 
        in the world competed for position and prestige in this race piloting identical cars. </code>
